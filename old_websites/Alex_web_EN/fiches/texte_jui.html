        <font face="Comic Sans MS, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">When 
        you break an egg, you will see that the shell is very hard and that inside 
        there is both a white part and a yellow part called a yolk.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/soon.gif" width="170" height="157" align="left" alt="Soon">The 
        egg is produced by the hen, which has been fertilized by the male cock. 
        In the middle of the egg yolk there is a seed. This seed feeds on the 
        white of the egg and the yolk, and grows bigger. The shell protects the 
        developing seed by stopping germs from getting in and attacking it. However, 
        for all this to happen, the hen must sit on the egg and keep it warm. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The eggs that you eat are collected as soon as they are laid, so the seed 
        has not had time to develop. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/pouss.gif" width="110" height="92" align="left">If the 
        farmer lets the hen sit on the egg, a little chick will break the shell 
        with its beak 21 days later. The chicks grow very quickly. As soon as 
        they hatch out of the egg they can walk on their own, and when they are 
        5 weeks old they are already quite big chickens and are ready to lay their 
        first eggs.<img src="images/poule.gif" width="123" height="175" align="right"><br>
        <br>
        Hens tend to lay a lot more eggs in summer because it is lighter outside.<br>
