            <center><h1>Other Useful Websites</h1></center><br>
            <p>Here follows a list of websites that have been of fundamental importance for my recreation of the Trilogy Worlds, and for gathering informations about the videogames.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Videogames Information/Contet</h3>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li><p><a href="https://hypethefilm.blogspot.com" target="_blank" class="text_shadow">Hype The Time Quest - "The Film"</a> : amazing project of the making of a Hype film. You'll find here many pictures and content gathered over the course of more than 10 years. They were also kind enough to share with me many pictures and videos that I've used on my <a href="https://youtube.com/@playmo90strilogy?si=QxLTyR2ywx8AeA46" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> and in the fixing of the <a href="javascript:changeFrameContent('../old_websites/index.html');" target="_self">Trilogy Websites</a>.ðŸ©µ</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="https://hype.tips" target="_blank" class="text_shadow">Hype.tips</a> : website dedicated to "Hype - The Time Quest", it contains basically everything you'd want to know about the game. It was particularly useful to me in my project, because of the infromations about all the game's characters!</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="https://raym.app" target="_blank" class="text_shadow">Raym.app</a> : reverse-engineering of the Trilogy games, as well as other UbisoftÂ® games, so that you can explore the maps of every level! Unfortunately, though, the Pentium 3 games' maps are not available yet.</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="https://github.com/RayCarrot/RayCarrot.RCP.Metro" target="_blank" class="text_shadow">Rayman Control Panel</a> : even though this program is meant for the Rayman games, it was useful to extract the Textures of the Playmobil games that run on the same engine, by using its "Utilities" panel.</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="https://raymanpc.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=74964" target="_blank" class="text_shadow">Tonictac</a> : program to extract the audios of the games. It doesn't extract 100% of the files, but it still does an amazing job! <a href="https://app.box.com/s/z7iiex4bzo23rppg81ynd64dzq9ln7rs" target="_blank">Download link</a>.</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="https://archive.org/search?query=Playmobil+Interactive" target="_blank" class="text_shadow">Internet Archive</a> : like the name suggests, it archives tons of old games and software that nowdays are considered Abandonware, and can not be found or bought anywhere else.</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041012084432/http://www.playmobil-interactive.com/" target="_blank" class="text_shadow">Wayback Machine</a> : part of the Internet Archive, it stores many old websites that are not available anymore. Nedless to say that without it, the Trilogy old Websites would've been lost forever in 2005.</p></li>
                </ul>
            
                <br>
                <h3>PLAYMOBILÂ® Creation</h3>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li><p><a href="https://www.playmodb.org" target="_blank" class="text_shadow">PlaymoDB</a> : database of PLAYMOBILÂ® instructions-booklets and manuals, extremely useful to find specific parts and their relative reference number.</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="https://www.mundobil.com" target="_blank" class="text_shadow">Mundobil</a> : same as PlaymoDB, this is a PLAYMOBILÂ® parts and sets database, that also sells some of the parts. To be used together with PlaymoDB because sometimes it has informations that the other lacks, and viceversa!</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="https://www.playmobil.com/en-gb/spareparts-buildinginstructions/" target="_blank" class="text_shadow">PLAYMOBILÂ® Official Spare-Parts and Building Instructions</a> : the official PLAYMOBILÂ® website allows you to purchase spare parts for a very low price, and to download building instructions manuals. The bad news is that not all spare parts and manuals are available...<br>This link is for the USA online store, but you can find the "Spare Parts" section also in the online store of your country!</p></li>
