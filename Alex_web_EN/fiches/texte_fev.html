        <font face="Comic Sans MS, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A baby 
        cow is called a calf. <br>
        <br>
        The calf grows in its mother's womb for 9 months. As soon as the calf 
        is born the cow starts to produce milk to feed it because it can't eat 
        grass like its Mother. The mother cow will produce milk for about 10 months 
        after the calf is born. <img src="images/soon.gif" width="170" height="157" align="left" alt="Coming soon"> 
        <br>
        <br>
        However, she produces much more milk than her little one really needs. 
        Every day she produces between 20 and 30 litres of milk: that means she 
        could fill 20 to 30 bottles with milk. Did you know that one cow could 
        provide breakfast for around 60 children like you?! <img src="images/lait.gif" width="67" height="153" align="right" alt="Milk"> 
        <br>
        <br>
        But don't forget that the cow needs some of her milk to feed her little 
        one, so the farmer cannot take all of her milk! <img src="images/fromage.gif" width="163" height="93" align="left" alt="Cheese"><br>
        <br>
        With cows' milk, you can also make butter, cheese and cream. Mrs Cow really 
        does feed a lot of people!<br>

        <img src="images/vaches.gif" width="264" height="160" align="right" alt="Cows">Sheep 
        and goats also produce milk to feed their babies; their milk has a stronger 
        taste and is mostly used to make cheese rather then to drink. </font>
