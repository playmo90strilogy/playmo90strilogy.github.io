            <h3>This Website's Goals</h3>
            <p>This website's primary goal is to preserve informations about the videogames <b><i>"Laura's Happy Adventures"</i></b>, <b><i>"Hype - The Time Quest"</i></b> and <b><i>"Alex Builds His Farm"</i></b> developed by PLAYMOBILÂ® Interactive and UbisoftÂ® Montreal in the 1990s.
                <br>Since that the more the time passes, the hardest is to find content about these games, I wanted to gather all I could find around the Internet in one place, so that fans could have an easy access to everything, and so that the games wouldn't fall into oblivion.
            </p>
            <p>The secondary goal of the website is to show the recreation of the three games' worlds with the PLAYMOBILÂ® toys, providing a detailed description on how they were made.<br>I've received many questions about this topic, that's why I thought I would include everything here to help other fans to recreate our favorite videogames' characters!</p>
            <p>I had never made a website before, so I know this won't be perfect, but I hope that it's going to be good enough!ðŸ˜‚
                <br>If you have some suggestions on how I could improve it, or if you just want to reach out to me for whatever reason, you can send an email at <a href="mailto:playmo90strilogy@gmail.com">playmo90strilogy@gmail.com</a>, or contact me on <a href="javascript:goToBottom()">social media</a>.
            </p>
            <p>This is a non-profit website, completely free of charge and advertising. If you want to help me keep it alive, you can make a <a href="javascript:changeFrameContent('./donate.html')" target="_self">donation</a>.ðŸ’›</p>

            <h3>Playmo 90s Trilogy - The Story</h3>

            <p style="float:left;">Big fan of the PLAYMOBILÂ® toys since I was a child, I grew up playing with these figures and letting my imagination go wild creating stories and fantastic worlds. 
                <br>I loved them so much that the first ever video I've published on YouTube when I was 10 years old, was a PLAYMOBILÂ® stop-motion short about an Arabic King!ðŸ‘‘</p>
            <div class="caption_div" style="float:right; margin-left: 25px;"><div class="picture_div gradient_border"><img src="./images/1_1.jpg" alt="0" data-title="My mom and I with the Victorian PLAYMOBILÂ® mansion in the background, in 1999." class="picture" onclick="javascript:enlargeImg(this, 'h')"></div><p>My mom and I with the Victorian PLAYMOBILÂ® mansion in the background, in 1999.</p></div>

                <p>One day, in the early 2000s, my mom brought home a videogame called <b><i>"Laura's Happy Adventures"</i></b>, and to my surpirse it was a PLAYMOBILÂ® videogame!
                <br>Nedless to say that I loved it immediately, even if I was still a bit too young to play it by myself... but that didn't stop me, because I begged her everyday to play it with me! (Miss Clara's antrum scared the heck out of me for no apparent reason.)</p>
   
                <p>Shortly after, it came <b><i>"Hype - The Time Quest"</i></b> and its amazing story about medieval knights, magicians, and time travel... all things that I loved as a kid.
                <br>I had always known that there was another videogame in the Trilogy, but some time had passed and at that point I was out of the target audience for Alex, so I have never played it when I was little.</p>
                
            <p style="float:right;">Fast forward 20 years, give or take, and I've got the urge of re-visiting the PLAYMOBILÂ® videogames' worlds.
                After resolving a few technical issues of installing and starting the games, I was able to re-play those amazing stories, and I had also finally got a copy of <b><i>"Alex Builds His Farm"</i></b> to find out what the third and final story of the Trilogy was all about.
                I loved this game too! In all its semplicity I found Alex's farm world to be peaceful and relaxing to run around.
            </p>
            <div class="caption_div" style="float:left;  margin-right: 25px; margin-top: 10px;"><div class="picture_div gradient_border"><img src="./images/2.jpg" alt="1" data-title="Me playing with the PLAYMOBILÂ® modern house in 2004." class="picture" onclick="javascript:enlargeImg(this,'h')"></div><p>Me playing with the PLAYMOBILÂ® modern house in 2004.</p></div>

            <p>And then an idea came to me... "Wouldn't it be nice to re-assemble my old PLAYMOBILÂ® Victorian Mansion (Laura's House), getting Hype's castle and Alex's House, and putting them next to each other?"
                <br>And that's how the <b><i>"Playmo 90s Trilogy"</i></b> was born! 
                <br>The situation got a bit out of hand when "the houses" became "all the characters", and then "all the characters" became "the worlds"...but you get the gist.ðŸ˜‚
            </p>
            
            <p>What I've noticed in these 3 years since this hobby was born, is that it's extremely hard to find informations about these games.
                <br>Hype's fandom is definitely the largest out of the three, so it's a bit easier to come around its content, but for Laura and Alex the presence on the Internet is basically non-existent.</p>
                <p>That's why the <a href="https://youtube.com/@playmo90strilogy?si=QxLTyR2ywx8AeA46" target="_blank">Playmo 90s Trilogy YouTube channel</a> was created, and now, this website. 
                <br>To give justice to these three amazing games and to not let them be forgotten.
